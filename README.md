# Pixlemon

Pixlemon is an unfinished game project inspired by the world of Pok√©mon. It aims to recreate the experience of exploring a pixelated, top-down map filled with creatures to discover and interact with. Please note that the game is still a work in progress due to the complexity of the mechanics involved in its development.

## Additional Details
Throughout the development of Pixlemon, I embarked on a journey of exploration and learning. It was my first time working with JSON, and despite the initial challenges, I was determined to utilize it for handling map collisions. I must admit, it was quite a learning curve for me, but I persevered and managed to successfully incorporate JSON for the collision functionality.

I dedicated a significant amount of time to Pixlemon, constantly experimenting with new concepts and techniques. The project took longer than expected because I wanted to make sure I tried out different approaches and explored innovative ideas. This experimental mindset added to the development timeline, but it also allowed me to gain valuable experience and expand my skills.

While I made progress with the collision system, implementing battle zones using a similar approach proved to be more challenging than anticipated. I encountered unexpected obstacles along the way, which required me to reassess my strategy and explore alternative solutions.

Another new concept I delved into was working with the canvas, which provided the foundation for the game's visual presentation. I faced alot of sitbacks, particularly related to handling collisions and implementing smooth movement using the WASD keys. However, with patience and perseverance, I managed to make significant headway and achieve satisfactory results.

Given the extensive experimentation and the time-consuming nature of the project, I couldn't accomplish everything I had initially planned within the desired timeframe. However, I want to assure you that Pixlemon is a labor of love, and I am committed to continue its development. There are still outstanding tasks and features on my roadmap, and I will do my best to incorporate them in future updates.

I sincerely appreciate your understanding and support and thank you.
